        <h2>PIH – Whittier Medical Center </h2>
        <p class="font-size-22">
          The PIH Health Family Medicine Residency Program is an unopposed program that serves the communities of Los
          Angeles & Orange counties as well as the San Gabriel Valley. Our mission is to provide students and residents
          with a rich, broad-based, and multidisciplinary graduate medical education that is built on a culturally
          competent foundation. Our residents provide medical care to underserved socio-economic populations and
          multi-cultural communities where they establish their roles as community health providers. By presenting our
          residents with these targeted and fundamental learning experiences throughout their training, we aim to guide
          and inspire them to continue to provide the same type of outreach and medical services in similar communities
          upon graduation

        </p>
        <p class="font-size-22">
          Our program offers an exemplary model of working as a member of a collaborative healthcare team that includes
          hospital and ambulatory specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, social workers, behavioral
          scientists, and community partners. Our learners work directly with attending physicians in numerous
          specialties, allowing for exceptional and personalized training opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="font-size-22">
          Medical students are expected to have basic medical knowledge consistent with their experience and level of
          training. They should be capable of self-directed learning as they improve their clinical skills and medical
          knowledge. Students are expected to function as part of a healthcare team and always use their judgment in
          seeking guidance and conducting themselves in a manner befitting their chosen profession.
